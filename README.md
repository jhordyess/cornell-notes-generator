# Cornell Notes Generator

A simple Cornell notes generator with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

After learning how to take the best notes, I create this.

## Description

Choose the color with the picker, then the pdf is automatically re-rendered.

Default properties: letter paper, double-sided, 1cm of margin, portrait letter, and some predefined values.

### Evolution from LaTeX

The original idea was started with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and its package [TikZ](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf), see the code and example: [https://github.com/jhordyess/cornell-notes-generator-latex](https://github.com/jhordyess/cornell-notes-generator-latex)

Now uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) to have more control for: lengths, rows, columns, use portrait or landscape, view in the letter or A4 size, single-sided or double-sided, and so on.

## To-Do

- Add form for customize the pdf output.
- The color picker transparency doesn't work.
- Add more features ðŸ¤”
